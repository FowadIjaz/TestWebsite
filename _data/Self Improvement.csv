Movie,Gattaca,Ethan Hawke,SciFi/Fantasy,90,1997,Completed,-,-----,Ethan Hawke tries to get accepted into the space program in the future since his genes mean he will never be able to get a good job.,"Got some things very wrong about what genes will be able to tell us, or how far genetic alteration will be able to go. If in thefuture they are able to geneticall alter humans to be so strong, surely there would have been other advances to allow people with ethan's condition to live longer as well? It was an interesting premise but poorly executed",6,N

Movie,Get out,,Horror,,,Completed,,2018-06-17,,"Some black guy must spend a weekend at his white girlfriend's parents, only to find out they abduct black people to transfer their brains into their bodies and live through them basically. Kind of a hilarious premise if you sit down and think about it. Good for a horror movie I guess, I feel like it didnt have enough that we couldnt guess from the trailers and stuff. It felt pretty beat for beat. The ending was a pretty good surprise, with us thinking it would be the police officer but it turned out to be the TSA agent. Bit inappropriate comic relief for the type of movie that it was though",7,N
Movie,This is spinal tap,,Comedy,,,Completed,,2018-07-17,,"Follows the lives of a 80s rock band from their founding in the 50s/60s, to their dabbling in drugs in the 70s, to their decline in the 80s.

In the meantime Ridley scott may or may not decide if harrison ford was a replicant all along. It was ok, not great not awful, as people have pointed out the best part of it was Rutger hauer, who was genuinely awesome. The fact that the scenes were reordered to tell a coherent narrative and so much tinkering was done with the story somehow takes away from the movie. However, I do kind of like the idea of Harrison ford's character being a replicant, more so than other people, who hate the movie solely because of it. ",7,N

Movie,End of watch,,Action,,,Completed,,2018-07-17,,"Zavala and Brandon (?) get up to various hijinks while patrolling the LA streets. In the end they make you think Brandon dies but it's actually Zavala. Mild shock! A very average movie, with zero payoff on any of the major storylines set up, like the one jaded guy saying the LAPD would fuck them from behind (it didnt), and the FBI who said don't get involved (they didn't), and the illegal immigrant runners who took a hit out on these two particular cops despite the fact that they sort of stumbled onto the two scenes of weird shit going on. The two main characters were complete fucking jokes, didn't follow proper procedure, which got them into trouble like the time they forgot to ask how many fucking kids there are in the house on fire. It was all tension and no payoff. When you did get a payoff, like the reveal taht there bodies in the ground, the characters ham it up and mug for the camera as if they are genuinely shocked, except two scenes ago they saw the same thing. So it's not like they haven't seen the same thing, it's just that they have to keep acting like they are seein gsomething gross. An overall extremely average movie. Actually just writing this made me realize that 6 is generous, it deserves a 4 for being insulting. The director thought he was filming training day but in reality he was filming fucking chronicle. ",4,N
Movie,Alien,,SciFi/Fantasy,,,Completed,,2018-07-17,,"The crew of a spaceship make one comically bad decision after the other, leaving Ripley, third in command, as the sole survivor, primarily because she isn't a fucking idiot. Not a bad horror movie for its time, but I am sure its legacy has been run into the ground with all the sequels. Fun and interesting movie, albeit the main characters were a little stupid. ",7,N
Movie,Arrival,,SciFi/Fantasy,,,Completed,,2018-08-17,,"That chick from superman looks really concerned while trying to solve why aliens are floating around places around the world. Marketed as a super smart film but didn't do nearly enough with the subject matter. The child's death happeneing after the events of the film was a good twist, but why did she need to act so surprised that she was going to end up with jeremy renner when it was being dropped left and right by the movie? And if she only ""remembered"" parts of the future at certain points doesn't that mean she had altered the future? or set up some kind of recursion? how does that play out? Then there was that scene where she is hallucinating one of the heptapods in her bunker... what was the point of that apart from providing a jump scare? Meh, well made movie but not anything special imo.",7,N
Movie,Krampus,,Horror,,,Completed,,2018-08-17,,"Kid wishes for his family to be all together for christmas, tears up his wish and visits a horrible demon upon his family. Great premise, but wished that the people weren't so stupid, listened a bit more to Omi. There was a feeling of people aren't going to stay dead throughout the whole movie because the people were too stupid to realize that their family members were gone for good.

Book,The Outlander,Gil Adamson,Adventure,,,Completed,Fatima,2017-01-17,"Story of Mary Boulton as she escapes her twin brothers-in-law after murdering her husband for being unfaithful. Along the way she meets colourful characters, like the old lady who likes to house runaways, the ridgerunner who abhors the company of men, the church father who is also a keen pugilist, the dwarf who owns the only store in the mining town she settles in. There is a big disaster as the mines cave in, killing the father and wiping out the town, and it is her picture in the paper after the disaster that alerts the twins to her presence. They take her to a nearby town to be tried, but she manages to escape by scraping cement away from the bars and riding out of town on a stolen horse (she does a clever thing here by stealing a drunkard's hat and making sure he sees her go down one way, then doubling back another). At the same time, the ridgerunner (who abandoned her earlier) is trying to find her after realizing he needs her in his life. The ridgerunner was apparently based on a real person, although the author took artistic liberties with his character. They finally meet, but in the morning it is the widow's turn to leave a note telling him to find her. A really touching story, filled with memorable characters, and you had to admire the strength of the widow. A woman surrounded by a harsh life but finding her little bit of peace in it. Wonderful, poignant, I loved it",,9,

Boring descriptions of a barren landscape that was supposed to be majestic but just got repetitive, and nothing really happens by the conclusion. Reality of space travel is that you don't take your helmet off on an alien ship the first thing when you come aboard and detect that there's oxygen. Just many, many anachronisms that aren't explained by the author being from an older time (the point of sci fi is to be able to imagine a world more advanced than yours, and to build it realistically within its own rules). They have the ability to train super smart chimps to do maintenance on their ships, but somehow don't carry land rovers in their spaceships... childishliy simplistic story",,5,

The explanation of each person's motives were so believable, the hurt one felt for some of the characters so painful, that the book seemed to be about real people. The helplessness of Snegirev as he threw away Alyosha's offered money, so that he could be able to face his sone with pride and show that he could not be bought... the business with the older brother Dmitry (mitya) took up too much of the book ultimately since it was not given a satisfactory finish, since he was found guilty anyway, but maybe that was the intention of the author, to show that no matter how eloquent the defendants speech was, mitya would not be released. And furthermore, he wasn't even guiltless of the crime since he did harbour ill will, it just so happened that he did everything save the crime itself. Ivan however, was also relatable in that he felt that he was responsible since he left the town as smerdyakov instructed. That was actually so relatable it was scary. ",,8,

Lots of cybernetic enhancements, leather trenchcoats and permanent sunglasses, designer drugs and artificial intelligences in matrix style cyber realities. The best thing was how absolutely unapologetic the author was about his use of his own world's jargon. There wasn't a single trace of affectation to his manner. In most books you can catch the author out, slipping in and out of jargon, or out of the internal logic of the world they occupy, particularly if the world is supposed to be ""eat or get eaten"" type of predatory world (RA salvatore and his dark elf society for instance).",,9,

Some of it was a bit trite, like the repetitio\n of the one guy who he killed with the grenade and the story he made up about him, but overall, it also had a lot of heart and it's a thing that people should read before marching gung ho into battle.

Book,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,Agatha Christie,Mystery,,,Completed,Reddit,2017-03-17,"Overall better than the other two agatha christie mysteries i've read, although still just a fluff-y murder mystery.

Book,And then there were none,Agatha Christie,Mystery,,,Completed,Reddit,2017-03-17,"Fluffy murder mystery, much like agatha christie's other books. Of the 3 I've read probably the least interesting because the characters are all 2 dimensional villains, so their murder isn't anything to feel remorse over, and because the inspectors at the end make giant leaps to come to the conclusion that the thing tying together the whole case is the fact that all the victims were involved in some sordid affair, when the whole point was that they had gotten away with their crimes so cleanly that nobody suspected them. Overall a poorly written book, probably started because of the unique premise. ",,5,
Book,A confederacy of Dunces,John Kennedy Toole,Comedy,,,Completed,Reddit,2017-04-17,"Ignatius Reilly is a gigantic man in his 30s, with a much bigger sense of his importance than is warranted, who has finished a masters but is unemployed, and a hypochondriac to boot. The book is too raw and too real at times. Kennedy toole managed to depict the prototypical neckbeard in 1962... He has to have been a time traveller, for how right he got everything, the solid disdain for everything and everyone else while doing nothing to improve himself, the constant complaints about ""his valve"" and disposition, the going to movies just to criticize them, the taking on crappy jobs because they afforded him the most liberty... Painful. Then there are funny parts with memorable characters, like patrolman mancuso, who is forced to dress up in costumes until he catches someone suspicious, the elderly miss trixie who wants nothing but to retire, except that mrs levy won't let her because she read psychology and thinks keeping active is the way to health ""keep my exercise board out of this!"" myrna minkoff, who is an equal to reilly in the crazy department. Ultimately Mr Levy comes to reilly to find out if he wrote the letter which will get his company sued into the ground, but reilly manages to get ms trixie to take the fall. Jones manages to get reilly to come to the night of joy and cause havoc so mancuso shows up, then lana lee the proprietress shows him a pornographic picture without realizing he is a cop (because he is dressed up). Mancuso makes a few arrests, gets promoted, while the appearance of ignatius in the paper is what causes irene to finally put her foot down and decide her son needs to be admitted to a mental hospital, Ignatius realizes his mother's plan because of her uncharacteristic outburst of sympathy and takes advantage of mynkoff who appears at the exact right moment to make his escape.

Book,The Company: Portrait of a murdered,Arabella Edge,Adventure,,,Completed,Found,2017-04-17,"The journey of exiled undermerchant Janez Cornelisz aboard the Batavia. He plans a mutiny with the captain against the Company Commandeur, but the ship gets shipwrecked. He devises a plan to fool the survivors into going to the neighbouring islands in search of food and water so he can starve them while keeping the provisions to himself. He exiles the previous council, puts together a new council and murders the sick so rations aren't wasted on them. He tricks the soldiers into going to one island, and the women and council to another, then smuggles back a handful of women including Lucretia with the promise of rations. Then he shares the women amongst his young followers. He turns the people on his own island into prisoners, shaving their heads and taking away their names, then has them build a lookout from coral. He lures the Predikant and his daughter away from their family with the lure of food then murders them while they are eating food. He has Lucretia raped by his right hand man Wouter while he watches because she rebuffs his advances herself. Really good book, the author really knew how to build up to a climax of horror, going from small atrocities to greater ones. The descriptions of the hunger and desperation of the women and children on seal island is particularly greusome. Suprisingly the book doesn't mention cannibalism, but is horrific enough without it. In particular the description of what he does to Lucretia, the Predikant, the women on Seal Island, the women he brings back to Traitor's island, it was all greusome. ",,8,
Book,Oliver Twist,Charles Dickens,Classic,,,Completed,-,2017-04-17,"The unfortunate tale of a young oliver twist, brought up by and hard treated by malicious adults at every turn, including the beadle mr bumble, the undertaker mr sowerberry, his apprentice noah claypole and his wife, who beat him for trying to defend his dead mother's name, and mr fagin, who tries to teach him how to be a pickpocket. All the while Dickens maintains the facade that the adults are in the right, referring to the jew as the ""kindly old gentleman"" and being unreasonably deferential to the station of parochial beadle. Ultimately Twist finds someone who is good enough to take care of him, the man who he is accused of stealing from, Mr brownlow. In an attempt to prove to his friend that oliver is a trustworthy fellow, brownlow entrusts oliver with 5 pounds and asks him to return some books to the bookseller. Nancy, an accomplice of Fagin and sikes, seizes oliver and pretends to be his sister to abduct him. Oliver is brought to fagin again, and sikes asks fagin for the use of oliver in robbing a house in the countryside. Oliver is shot in the process, and left in a ditch while sikes and his accomplices escape. It is found that Monks, another accomplice of fagin, is actually oliver's half brother (they share the same father) and has been paying fagin to turn oliver into a destitute criminal as revenge against his father for denying him his inheritance and hating him for being a low person. OIiver is nursed back to health at the house which he was supposed to rob, whose owner is Mrs Maley and her daughter Rose, also helped by the doctor Mr losberne. They help him find mr brownlow again, and nancy, burdened by her conscience, attempts contact with rose maley to try to bring monks to justice (since she heard monks and fagin discussing their plans with oliver). Meanwhile Noah claypole has been turned out of doors at the undertaker because mr bumble saw him getting naughty with charlotte the maid while the master was out, so noah steals money and makes his way to london, where he is met with fagin. He sees nancy make a rendezvous with mr brownlow and rose maley, and finds out she has betrayed fagin. He takes the information back to fagin, who tells sikes that nancy has been unfaithful. Sikes, infuriated, kills nancy and goes on the run, his guilty conscience pursuiing him all the time. He is eventually caught when even his accomplices find his crime too heinous and betray him (particularly charlie bates, one of the orphans). He runs to the roof to escape and tries to jump using a rope (but gets hanged by it instead). Oliver is brought into his inheritance by the signature of monks, which is intimated out of him. Fagin is caught and put to trial, and meets a horrible end on the gallows. Noah claypole is also caught, but informs on his colleagues and makes a living upholding the liquor laws by pretending to faint in front of establishments on sundays and denouncing anyone who gives him liquor to the authorities. ","well written, incisive satire, excellent political commentary on the underhand tactics of the poorhouses, the pickpockets, burglars, and theives. It appears that no one is safe on either side of the law (for example the incompetent judge who preside over mr brownlow's case against oliver, where brownlow doesn't even want to press charges). The unfortunate plight of young oliver makes this book a hard read at times, but there are as many funny bits, for example mr bumble's wooing of the mrs corney, and the subsequent sorrow he has of the marriage. A few too many coincidences, such as oliver being accused of robbing brownlow, who just happens to be an old friend of his fathers, then there's rose maley turning out to also be oliver's half sister, abandoned at an orphan house because monks and his mother didn't want her to be happy, etc. Some of the villains are just moustache twirlingly evil with no redeeming qualities, but you need a good villain in order ot have a good story, as the dursleys in harry potter attest. They don't have to be realistic to elicit strong emotions, and it may in fact hinder the narrative. So dickens does a great job of portraying characters with their own little quirks, and he paints a very complete picture. His characters are all memorable and fun. ",9,
Book,David Copperfield,Charles Dickens,Classic,,,Completed,-,2017-05-17,"The tale of David copperfield, whose mother is a widower who lives with the maid Pegotty. She decides to remarry a man named Murdstone, and he and his sister make life a hell for David and his mother. She is forced to be less affectionate towards her son and be more strict, and it breaks her heart but she does it anyways. Finally David gets a caning from Mr Murdstone but as he does he bits murdstone's hand and is sent away to a boarding school because of it. There he meets a lad named steerforth, who is rich and charming and a little bit arrogant. However, while David is there he is told that his mother has died. He returns home and is sent away by mr murdstone to work in a winery that they own putting labels on bottles. It's unfit work for him and he hates it, and resolves to run away to his aunt in hopes that she will take care of him. While he is working there he lodges with the Micawbres, a family who is always in dire straits due to Mr micawbre's inability to get a job and their debtors always hounding them. David's plan is successful, and his aunt takes custody of him away from the murdstones, who are glad of it. David starts living with some friends of his aunts, whos name is betsy trotwood, agnes and her father Mr Wickfield, who is a lawyer. They have a man who works for them named uriah heep, who has a fawning, 'umble way that david finds disturbing. There is a doctor with a young wife close by where David gets his education. Doctor Strong  is a learned but old man, all he wants to do is work on his dictionary. Meanwhile his wife is suspected of loving her cousin and only marrying the doctor to get her family out of dire straits, so the cousin is sent to india. She later proves that she loved the doctor. David starts training to become a kind of lawyer called a proctor, his aunt paying the fee to get him apprenticed at the firm spenlow and jorkins. Spenlow likes to say that jorkins is a hardass, but jorkins is actually no such thing, humour humour. David visits mr spenlows house and falls in love with his daughter dora. Spenlow objects to the marriage, but he dies, and david marries her. It turns out she's an airhead and if david had realized it earlier he may not have married her. When she dies he finally returns to marry Agnes, who has him happily. In the meantime, Pegotty's brother who takes up two orphans, ham and Em'ly, wants them to get married to each otehr. However, Steerforth elopes with Em'ly, and then abandons her somewhere in Italy with butler, Littimer, a prim and proper man who always makes david feel inadequate. She comes back to London, where he father has been looking for her all this time, and she and her father quit the country to go make a new beginning elsewhere. The micawbres join them as they can't seem to make their way in the old world. Steerforth dies in a raging sea storm, while Ham dies trying to rescue him not knowing who it was. Finally, David's other Childhood classmate, tommy traddles, eventually becomes a judge and marries the girl of his dreams, despite being a pretty unfortunate boy. 

","Overall a very moving story with many humorous bits, including the Barkis's courtship of pegotty that young David had no understanding of ""barkis is willing,"" Pegotty's buttons which bursted when she hugged him tight, and the butler at the hotel who helped him eat his food and then accused him of being a fatty. Also a lot of touching scenes such as Dr Strong's reconciliation with his wife annie, David's mother's death, and more. Overall a great little novel. more humourous than oliver twist, which was more darkly satirical, and I guess more representative of a happy time in Dicken's life since he had acheived success by then.",9,
Book,Great Expectations,Charles Dickens,Classic,,,Completed,-,2017-05-17,"Little Pip encounters a criminal while he is visiting his parents' graves, and he is sworn into secrecy as well as helping the criminal free himself. Cowed, Pip steals some food and a file from his Uncle Joe's smithy. When the police come searching for the criminal, he and Joe join the search party, while Pip has his heart in his throat the entire time about his role in the escape being discovered. The criminal is found in a deadlock with another prisoner, and the prisoner is happy to return as long as the other prisoner is also imprisoned. Pip starts visiting the house of Miss Havisham, a woman whose lover left her at the altar and she never stopped greiving, stopping the clocks in her house, and letting her wealthy brewery go to ruin. She also adopted estella, an orphan girl and brought her up to believe that it was women's duty to break men's hearts. Estella is arrogant and cruel to Pip, but he falls in love with her nevertheless. Meanwhile his sister, wife of uncle joe, is attacked and left an invalid. Orlick, the journeyman smith under Joe is suspected but found innocent, as mrs joe gargery doesn't appear to be distressed by him or antagonistic towards him. Pip suddenly finds out he has ""great expectations,"" which he will come into bit by bit, as long as he doesn't inquire about who his backer is. Thinking that it is Miss havisham that did it, he thinks she has made him a gentleman with the hope that he marry estella. Mr Jaggers, the man who is managing the affairs of the great expectations, is a lawyer from london, and Pip gets pocket money from him while also seeing how jaggers conducts his affairs. Jaggers conducts his affairs like no other lawyer. He keeps not a cent in his house, but hopes that someone will rob him so that he can take them to trial. He wears an ostentatious watch, knowing that no fence onthe street would ever touch it. 

He has one particualr clerk, mr wemmick, who helps pip immensely. He wears a facade while at jagger's office, whilch he drops when he is at home with his dear deaf father, who he refers to as ""the Aged"". He drops the facade when at home, and helps pip navigate the difficulty of finding out that the man sending him money is not miss havisham but the convict he met at the start of story, trying to repay back the kindness pip did to him and also trying to make a ""little gentlman"" of his own. Pip is mortified, especially because he has used the money to try to help his hopeless friend Herbert Pocket make a living in the business world. Finally PIp gets a letter to meet back at the swamp in his hometown, he goes and is almost killed by Orlick, but Herbert sees the note and runs to help Pip.

Pip loses his great expectations and must work and rely on the charity of his friend herbert now, who has opened an office in egypt. As for estella, she marries Pip's archenemy, bentley drummle as an act of defiance against ms havisham, who probably thought her estella could do a lot better. It also comes out that estella was magwitch;s daughter, a fact which he is informed by PIP on his deathbed. Also, her mother works for Jaggers as a maid, having been successfully defended against the charge of murdering another woman by Jagger's skillful lawyering. ","Did not enjoy as much as DC or OT, but may have been suffereing Dickens fatigue by that point. It was not bad by any means, Dickens still had the flare of catching all the nuance of childhood, all the dilemmas, all the fears, all the happinesses. Even his likeness of the adolescent pip ran true, from running into debts to avowals to correct his actions that never came to pass. I suppose if the theme was the subversion of great expections, Dickens accomplished that feat. The money turned out to be not from Ms Havisham. Pip didnt marry the girl of his dreams. We thought orlick didnt commit the crime but he did. In a way, dickens managed to subvert our expectations in devious forms. However, certain things about the novel got boring or grating fast, including the constant pangs of guilt Pip got over being mean to joe. Ultimately, the novel didnt give a proper resolution, perhaps in fitting with the title? Wonder if that was intended by dickens...",8,
Book,Gone With the Wind,Margaret Mitchell,Classic,,,Completed,-,2017-06-17,"Tells the story of Scarlett O'hara, a beautiful Georgian belle who starts off thinking of nothing but dances and beaux, and eventually becomes a hardened woman after the hardships she endures during and after the americal civil war.

Initially happy to have boys chasing after her, there is one boy who catches her attention because he doesn't seem to care for her charms: Ashely Wilkes. When she hears news that he will be marrying Melanie Hamilton, she realizes that she has been so cool towards him that he may not know how she feel about him. She resolves to tell him at a party. While there, she can't help trying to make him jealous by attracting as many beaux to her as possible, including the unfortunate charles hamilton, who has already been engaged to marry honey wilkes. At the party she also meets the strange rhett butler, who she is informed has been ostracized by his family because he impregnated a girl then refused to marry her. She lays her heart bare to Ashley in private, but Ashley rebuffs her. Rhett overhears the goings-in and teases scarlett mercilessly. Scarlett begins fuming, and resolving to get her revenge, she decides to marry charles hamilton, stealing away honey's beau, and hoping that she will also hurt melanie and ashley in the process. At the same party, it is announced that the south will go to war against the north. 

Hamilton dies not long after joining the army, and Scarlett, who is pregnant with his child, goes to live in atlanta with charles' aunt pitty and his sister melanie. Scarlett hates melanie because ashley chose her over scarlett, but melanie seems to be completely unaware of it. Scarlett is angry at hamilton for leaving her a widow, because she can't participate in society like she could before. She decides to coerce aunt pitty into attending a ball because it's for ""the cause"" and meets butler there again. Butler sees her predicament and helps relieve her of it by asking her to dance and refusing  to relinquish his generous donation unless it was her. Butler is a rich man at this point due to being a smuggler for the honourable cause, but has a bad reputation for possibly speculating on food and profiteering from the war in general. After a long and arduous campaign, the war is lost and atlanta is under seige. Unfortunately this is exactly the time melanie has to give birth. Scarlett manages to get rhett's attention and he steals them a carriage to get them out of atlanta. He leaves them on the trail back to Tara, because he suddenly decides to join the war effort. Scarlett makes her way home, seeing all the carnage and looted plantations along the way. When she finally gets home, she is relieved to see it still standing, but finds out that her mother ellen is dead and her father gerald has lost his mind. All of their slaves have fled except for a loyal few, and all the food in the house has been looted by the Yankees. Scarlett works hard to make the land grow some food, even killing a Yankee robber, and keeping a yankee regiment from taking charles hamilton's sword. Her sisters suellen and carreen recover from the plague that killed their mother, but scarlett isn't thankful since it's more mouths to feed. As the south has surrendered by this point, scarlett is loath to help others, but is forced to make room for soldiers wandering home due to melanie's insistence. Thinking of ashley, she gives in. Eventually the land starts becoming more stable and bringing in enough food to feed the family as well as cotton to pay the taxes, but suddenly fortune changes again when Scarlett finds out Gerald's old overseer who was let go was thinking of buying the plantation as revenge for being fired. He would ensure that the tax was too high for scarlett to pay then buy Tara when it was foreclosed. Scarlett resolves to go to town and get the money from Rhett, who she has heard is staying there, no matter what the price.

Rhett is currently in jail for killing an uppity negro, but manages to humiliate scarlett by making her beg for the money and asking her to become his mistress for it. As she leaves the jailhouse in a rage, she bumps into frank kennedy, who is to be suellen's beau. She finds out that Kennedy has started a business selling surplus supplies, and inwardly raging that the incompetent suellen would leave with frank kennedy's money, she decides to marry frank herself. Using Frank's money, and forcing him to charge more for the surplus goods, she buys a few lumber mills, knowing that lumber will be in short supply in the rebuilding of atlanta. She manages to make enough money to protect Tara from being defaulted due to nonpayment of taxes. 

How does Frank Kennedy die? I can't remember quite well enough, but Scarlett ends up with Rhett. She has a son from her first husband who is called wade hampton, then possibly a second son from frank, and then finally a girl from Rhett. Rhett treats her like a queen, and scarlett uses the money to make a new house full of garish decorations because  scarlett lacks taste. She invites all the Yankees around because she doesn't care about keeping pretences with the old guard. Ashlley wilkes gets wounded in a raid on the old shanty town because Scarlett gets almost raped by a couple of negros. is Frank Kennedy killed in that raid? It may be...

Anyways, Rhett loves his daughter so much that he reforms and tries to change his image so that the southern families will accept her. He spoils her so much that when she wants a horse, he gives it to her. She then dies riding it. Scarlett yells at him that he killed her, and he is unable to forgive her for that. 

When she is told that Melanie wilkes is dying she goes to see her, and realizes that she didn't really love ashley, it was only not having him that made her want him more. She decides to go back to Rhett, only to realize that Rhett has stopped loving her. He had been a tease, a flirt, but his love had been real. he wouldn't have done what he did for any other girl. When the daugheter was born the love was transferred to her, but when she died his love ran out. He leaves her alone, in the house that she built, all alone.","Great book, immensely moving. Amazing how it made you feel for a cold hearted, manipulative, shallow woman like Scarlett, but it did. Great evidence for the fact that your protagonist shouldn't be this super perfect being. ",9,

Told from the perspective of the Chief, a big Indian who doesn't speak, the book takes us through the rise and fall of mcmurphy, his wins and losses in the war against the Combine, culminating in a hedonistic party. billy bibbit loses his virginity to a Candy, and in the morning is found in a compromising position by the head nurse. She uses psychological torture against him, and he kills himslef. Then she blames Mr Mcmurphy and gets him lobotomized. In the end the chief kills the husk of a man and runs away back home.","Very similar to Freak the mighty in that its the story of the disenfranchised getting some hope from outside themselves, someone who inspires them to be greater than they already are. Wonder what it means if what the nurse was doing was perhaps more inocuous than randle thought it was, with most of the poeple there volunteering to remain there, or the poeple who didn't take their meds and then had seizures and breakdowns. It blurs the lines a little and reminds us that the wildness of Mcmurphy isn't always a desirable qulaity. In that sense there is more maturity than just throwing caution to the wind and hoping for the best, but... the ending kind of contradicts that. It's a powerful book nevertheless",8,

Mike is damaged in the attack and goes back to being a dumb machine, the professor dies after having been president and seeing the moon achieve independence, and Manuel welcomes wyoming into his family as a wife","Excellent book, really brilliant. Really brought the author's vision to life, with perfect descriptions, perfect omissions, perfect terse language, perfect slang and jargon, and perfect humour. The only thing that was a little offputting was how easily the main characters succeeded in everything they tried, and how the AI was just a macguffin for the broader story of how the moon got its independednce; once its task was complete it just vanished into the void. Then again, I guess this was just a fun little romp and not really looking to get into the philosophy of what it means to be human, and so forth. ",9,

I see it as a clinging to morals that are failing you. Even he acknowledged it at the end of the book when he regretted having thrown money back in the face of the land lady. What drove him to be so bitter to people he met for such a short period? Why did he have this insane desire to be respectable in everyone's eyes? I found it troubling reading this because of all the parallels I could draw with my own life, how I appear to be sabotaging my own progression because I want to throw shit back in people's faces and say no, keep your charity. It's dumb but I can't help it. Does being poor sharpen this attitude in oneself, knowing that I am too poor to actually return any of it? Do rich people not have these hangups? What's the solution, does it make sense to practice generosity so it becomes a part of our natures? 

The fact that I can give graciously but not take graciously shows what is actually wrong inside my psyche. Making giving a weapon, and taking a weapon is the worst thing I could do. It's a bad habit that I need to break out of. And reading books like this help with that.

Heathcliffes maltreatment of his son in his final days is nothing short of diabolical. It was a beautiful, dark and twisted story, exactly as good as I remembered it. One reviewer called it a Titanic mind that came up with it and I agree. And like a sudden burst of bad weather eventually calms, the storm passes and everything is returned to its rightful place. There was a great injustice done when heathcliffe was forced to flee the place he ahd called home, and forsake the woman that he loved.

He becomes a quiet boy who doesnt like to do anything until one day when Amir is flying a kite and he manages to get sohrab to smile.","Lots of sad moments, ultimately I was grateful when unlikely things happened that jerked me out of the story and reminded me this was just a story. For example, when Assef is blinded by Sohrab by the slingshot, or when they fly a kite towards the end. I felt the sotry had too much unnecessary melodrama like when Sohrab cut his wrists because he didnt want to go back in an orphanage. Plots twists based on misunderstandings are always so meh. Ovearll a story that tugs at the heartstrings, for sure, and shows a side of Afghanistan that I never knew. Im dying to know how much of it is true though. 7/10",7,

Movie,Get out,,Horror,,,Completed,,2018-06-17,,"Some black guy must spend a weekend at his white girlfriend's parents, only to find out they abduct black people to transfer their brains into their bodies and live through them basically. Kind of a hilarious premise if you sit down and think about it. Good for a horror movie I guess, I feel like it didnt have enough that we couldnt guess from the trailers and stuff. It felt pretty beat for beat. The ending was a pretty good surprise, with us thinking it would be the police officer but it turned out to be the TSA agent. Bit inappropriate comic relief for the type of movie that it was though",7,N

In the meantime Ridley scott may or may not decide if harrison ford was a replicant all along. It was ok, not great not awful, as people have pointed out the best part of it was Rutger hauer, who was genuinely awesome. The fact that the scenes were reordered to tell a coherent narrative and so much tinkering was done with the story somehow takes away from the movie. However, I do kind of like the idea of Harrison ford's character being a replicant, more so than other people, who hate the movie solely because of it.",7,N

Movie,End of watch,,Action,,,Completed,,2018-07-17,,"Zavala and Brandon (?) get up to various hijinks while patrolling the LA streets. In the end they make you think Brandon dies but it's actually Zavala. Mild shock! A very average movie, with zero payoff on any of the major storylines set up, like the one jaded guy saying the LAPD would fuck them from behind (it didnt), and the FBI who said don't get involved (they didn't), and the illegal immigrant runners who took a hit out on these two particular cops despite the fact that they sort of stumbled onto the two scenes of weird shit going on. The two main characters were complete fucking jokes, didn't follow proper procedure, which got them into trouble like the time they forgot to ask how many fucking kids there are in the house on fire. It was all tension and no payoff. When you did get a payoff, like the reveal taht there bodies in the ground, the characters ham it up and mug for the camera as if they are genuinely shocked, except two scenes ago they saw the same thing. So it's not like they haven't seen the same thing, it's just that they have to keep acting like they are seein gsomething gross. An overall extremely average movie. Actually just writing this made me realize that 6 is generous, it deserves a 4 for being insulting. The director thought he was filming training day but in reality he was filming fucking chronicle.",4,N
Movie,Alien,,SciFi/Fantasy,,,Completed,,2018-07-17,,"The crew of a spaceship make one comically bad decision after the other, leaving Ripley, third in command, as the sole survivor, primarily because she isn't a fucking idiot. Not a bad horror movie for its time, but I am sure its legacy has been run into the ground with all the sequels. Fun and interesting movie, albeit the main characters were a little stupid.",7,N
Movie,Arrival,,SciFi/Fantasy,,,Completed,,2018-08-17,,"That chick from superman looks really concerned while trying to solve why aliens are floating around places around the world. Marketed as a super smart film but didn't do nearly enough with the subject matter. The child's death happeneing after the events of the film was a good twist, but why did she need to act so surprised that she was going to end up with jeremy renner when it was being dropped left and right by the movie? And if she only ""remembered"" parts of the future at certain points doesn't that mean she had altered the future? or set up some kind of recursion? how does that play out? Then there was that scene where she is hallucinating one of the heptapods in her bunker... what was the point of that apart from providing a jump scare? Meh, well made movie but not anything special imo.",7,N
Movie,Krampus,,Horror,,,Completed,,2018-08-17,,"Kid wishes for his family to be all together for christmas, tears up his wish and visits a horrible demon upon his family. Great premise, but wished that the people weren't so stupid, listened a bit more to Omi. There was a feeling of people aren't going to stay dead throughout the whole movie because the people were too stupid to realize that their family members were gone for good. They could've taken stronger precautions when they realized what they were dealing with. Overall just a slightly above average horror movie rather than a gremlins level masterpiece (imo)",7,N
Movie,Fantastic Beasts and where to find them,,SciFi/Fantasy,,,Completed,,2018-09-17,,"Eddie Redmayne must act flustered and kooky while chasing CGI beasts across an old fashioned CGId New york city. Surprisingly not as bad as people said it was. Yes, the plot was probably stretched a bit to fill the movie, but it was a good kind of filler, lots of creativity, didn't seem like it strayed too far from the Harry Potter formula, while introducing some fun things in old new york city.",7,N
Movie,10 cloverfield lane,,SciFi/Fantasy,,,Completed,,2018-09-17,,"girl gets kidnapped by a crazy john goodman, and it turns out he's right about the doomsday scenario, but is also a crazy person. Pretty meh movie, the first twist was pretty predictable since this its pretty clear from the title of the movie that the doomsday threat is actually real. By the end of themovie it really ramps up to ridiculous proportions, with her leaving the bunker and finding the floating alien thing. and throwing a freaking molotov cocktail into its mouth. i'll admit that was pretty badass, but I mean why did the first half of the movie have to be a claustrophobic psychological thriller when we pretty much knew the event that John Goodman was talking about was real?",7,N
Movie,Popstar Never stop never stopping,,Comedy,,,Completed,,2018-09-17,,"Connor 4 real, an egotistic pop star must deal with his declining success as well as various other hijinx, with cameos from the entire universe of celebrities.

It appears that no one is safe on either side of the law (for example the incompetent judge who preside over mr brownlow's case against oliver, where brownlow doesn't even want to press charges). The unfortunate plight of young oliver makes this book a hard read at times, but there are as many funny bits, for example mr bumble's wooing of the mrs corney, and the subsequent sorrow he has of the marriage. A few too many coincidences, such as oliver being accused of robbing brownlow, who just happens to be an old friend of his fathers, then there's rose maley turning out to also be oliver's half sister, abandoned at an orphan house because monks and his mother didn't want her to be happy, etc. Some of the villains are just moustache twirlingly evil with no redeeming qualities, but you need a good villain in order ot have a good story, as the dursleys in harry potter attest. They don't have to be realistic to elicit strong emotions, and it may in fact hinder the narrative.

Also a lot of touching scenes such as Dr Strong's reconciliation with his wife annie, David's mother's death, and more.

It was not bad by any means, Dickens still had the flare of catching all the nuance of childhood, all the dilemmas, all the fears, all the happinesses. Even his likeness of the adolescent pip ran true, from running into debts to avowals to correct his actions that never came to pass. I suppose if the theme was the subversion of great expections, Dickens accomplished that feat. The money turned out to be not from Ms Havisham. Pip didnt marry the girl of his dreams. We thought orlick didnt commit the crime but he did. In a way, dickens managed to subvert our expectations in devious forms. However, certain things about the novel got boring or grating fast, including the constant pangs of guilt Pip got over being mean to joe.

Wonder what it means if what the nurse was doing was perhaps more inocuous than randle thought it was, with most of the poeple there volunteering to remain there, or the poeple who didn't take their meds and then had seizures and breakdowns. It blurs the lines a little and reminds us that the wildness of Mcmurphy isn't always a desirable qulaity.

I see it as a clinging to morals that are failing you. Even he acknowledged it at the end of the book when he regretted having thrown money back in the face of the land lady. What drove him to be so bitter to people he met for such a short period? Why did he have this insane desire to be respectable in everyone's eyes? I found it troubling reading this because of all the parallels I could draw with my own life, how I appear to be sabotaging my own progression because I want to throw shit back in people's faces and say no, keep your charity. It's dumb but I can't help it. Does being poor sharpen this attitude in oneself, knowing that I am too poor to actually return any of it? Do rich people not have these hangups? What's the solution, does it make sense to practice generosity so it becomes a part of our natures? 

The fact that I can give graciously but not take graciously shows what is actually wrong inside my psyche. Making giving a weapon, and taking a weapon is the worst thing I could do. It's a bad habit that I need to break out of. And reading books like this help with that.
